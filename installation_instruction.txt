Here’s how to get the Alzheimer’s Prediction app up and running:

1. Prepare the files
    Ensure alzheimers_prediction.py, requirements.txt, and the data file alzheimers_disease_data.csv are all in the same project folder. 

2. Install dependencies
    In your terminal (or command prompt), navigate to that folder and run: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch the Streamlit app
    From the same folder, execute in the terminal: streamlit run alzheimers_prediction.py
